/*
This is an abstract class, which means it cant be instantiated - you cant create an object from it directly.
Its used as base class, providing a blueprint for other classes.
A class becomes abstract when it has at least one pure virtual function -> virtual .... = 0. Its a placeholder function
meaning: "every subclass must provide its own version of this function".

When a function is marked virtual, C++ uses dynamic dispatch to decide at runtime which version of the function to call.
So that when you have a base class pointer (like Piece*), calling getSymbol() will run the correct function from the
subclass (like Pawn), not the base class version.
